<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>
Norman’s Action Cycle is a conceptual model that describes how users interact with a system through a sequence of cognitive and physical stages, from forming a goal to evaluating the result of their actions.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Purpose of the Model</h2>
<p>
The purpose of Norman’s Action Cycle is to identify where users face difficulties during interaction and to help designers reduce confusion by improving system feedback and control.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Seven Stages of Action</h2>
<ol>
<li>Forming the goal</li>
<li>Forming the intention</li>
<li>Specifying the action</li>
<li>Executing the action</li>
<li>Perceiving the system state</li>
<li>Interpreting the system state</li>
<li>Evaluating the outcome</li>
</ol>

<h2>Gulfs of Interaction</h2>
<article>
<h3>Gulf of Execution</h3>
<p>
The Gulf of Execution is the gap between the user’s intentions and the actions that the system allows them to perform.
</p>
</article>

<article>
<h3>Gulf of Evaluation</h3>
<p>
The Gulf of Evaluation is the gap between the system’s output and the user’s ability to understand whether their goal has been achieved.
</p>
</article>
</section>

<h2>Example: Toggle Switch</h2>
<p>
A user wants to turn on a light using a toggle switch:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: Turn on the light</li>
<li>Action: Flip the switch</li>
<li>Feedback: Light turns on</li>
<li>Evaluation: User confirms success</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Importance for Interface Design</h2>
<p>
Designers should reduce both gulfs by providing visible controls and clear feedback so users can easily understand and control the system.
